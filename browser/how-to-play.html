		</h2>
		<p>
		Shields can be used to block against your opponents attack. If an attack is shielded your opponent will use focus but you won't take damage. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>
		<img src='images/recharge-icon.png'> Focus 
		</h2>
		<p>
		The green bar is your focus metre. In order to attack you need to have focus. If you attack it will use a portion of your focus, always be aware of how much focus you have as it is crucial in planning your victory. 
		</p>

		<h2>
		<img src='images/smash-icon.png'> SMASH attack 
		</h2>
		<p>
		When your opponent is badly damaged (usually above 80%) then the smash attack icon will appear. The smash attack works in the same way as a normal attack except it deal a tremendous amount of damage and you can win the battle using it. Remember you need to have enough focus to use the smash attack, if you do not have enough focus then the smash attack icon will disappear. If a smash attack icon appears in your opponents stats area then it means your opponent has a smash attack available.
